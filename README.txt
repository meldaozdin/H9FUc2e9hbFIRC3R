Our goal is predict if the customer will subscribe (yes/no) to a term deposit (variable y)

In this context, data consist of binary dependent variable (y) and 13 independent variables were subjected to the data pre-processing step. Then, using the related methods, a model was created with 33 independent variables.

According to feature selection method, the most critical feature is duration. Therefore the company should focus duration time. Considering the duration, the 'y' rate of customers called from a cellular is higher.

Customer who are secondary education, marital status married, and job class management profiles tend to buy more investment products.
